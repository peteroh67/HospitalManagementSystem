This is a partly completed desktop app for a hospital management system developed with Java, JavaFX, SQL and SQLite. I gained experience with the Model-View-Controller design pattern, OOP best practices, database design and implementation. I attempted to develop the data access layer from scratch and learned the value of ORMs for speeding up development. My focus then shifted to learning Python and Networking fundamentals due to a new job and I abandoned this project.
