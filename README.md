This is a partly completed hospital management system. I learned about the Model-View-Controller design pattern, OOP best practices, designed and implemented a database with SQlite, but ultimately realised there is a reason ORM's like Hibernate exist and nobody uses JavaFX. My focus then shifted to learning Python and Networking fundamentals.
